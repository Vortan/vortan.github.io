### Goal

Create a tool that allows typing Armenian words using an english keyboard. This will empower people who are unfamiliar with the Armenian keyboard/alphabet to be to write in Armenian.

### Implementation

We would like to create a browser plugin (Chrome/Firefox) and a mobile keyboard (IOS/Android)
